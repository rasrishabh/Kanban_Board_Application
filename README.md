# Kanban Board Application

This Kanban board application is built using **React JS** and leverages the API provided by [QuickSell](https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment) to dynamically manage and organize tasks. Users can group and sort tasks based on their preferences, providing flexibility and efficiency in task management. The application also preserves the user's customized view even after a page reload.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Grouping**: Organize tickets by status, user, or priority.
- **Advanced Sorting**: Sort tickets by priority or title for better task prioritization.
- **Persistent View State**: Your selected grouping and sorting options are saved in local storage, ensuring your preferences are retained.
- **Priority Levels**: Tasks are assigned a priority value:
  - **Urgent** (4)
  - **High** (3)
  - **Medium** (2)
  - **Low** (1)
  - **No Priority** (0)
- **Responsive UI**: Designed to be visually appealing and adaptable to various screen sizes, offering an optimal user experience.
